# Hope-Hacks
Femina is latin for woman. Femina came about to be due to the world state around us. When womens health rights are being challenged, our team came together to help with the knowledge we have.
Our group consists of Brandon Carter, Natalie Ruiz, Brandon Ward, and Shade Hassan.
One of our two main features of our website is to be able to find pharmacy locations based on your real time location. You simply allow access to your location for the site and pharmacy locations should appear in the integrated google map with names and information on the right sidebar.
Our second main feature is our menstrual tracking tool. At 'Home', you can click 'get started quickly' with selecting the date of the last first day you had in your menstrual cycle. Go to settings next, and select your predicted how long your cycle lasts and how often they reoccur. Now going back to 'Home', your next predicted cycle is listed as well as on 'calendar', where it has marked down your current and future cycle. To manage/edit your entries or manually enter your start dates, you can visit 'log' or go to settings to delete all of your entered data completely.
